Hi :)
my name is Eric Cho and I am an alumni from The University of Georgia with a Bachelors degree in Computer Science. My earliest interaction with any code was in middle school where my friends and I found out how to mess around with each other's website pages by clicking "Inspect Element".

I thought it was just a funny gag to pull, but little did I know, that would set me on a path where I would get the chance to start coding in 2016 during my freshman year of college and continue to learn, not only in the United States, but abroad in Singapore as well.

After graduating, finding a niche in the world of tech was pretty straightforward. I grew up in a family of artists, so becoming a developer that focuses on full stack and frontend felt like the most natural way to be involved in both tech and visual design.

As of now, I have had the chance to be a part of amazing teams to create online products and solutions used by businesses across the country, and it has helped solidify my focus on creating online experiences to be able to reach and impact more people.

It continues to be my goal today.
